		<p><%= link_to "Govrate.co", 'http://www.govrate.co', :target => "_blank" %> is a project to increase government transparency and accountability. I wanted to create a web app that would allow people to find, rate, and review any service provided by the government at the cost of the taxpayer.</p>
		<p>The site also maps the organizational hierarchy, and provides information about the entity's executive(s), including whether they are appointed or elected, and their salary, if available.</p>
		<p>I decided to start with NYC since it has a dense population base exposed to many tax-funded entities, a lot of data is available online by the city or state, and it's usually my home.</p>
		<p>Some of the entities I started with include City and State agencies; post offices; DMV offices; subway, police, and fire stations; as well as recreational facilities such as parks. I wrote several crawlers to access this data and load it into my database.</p>
		<p><strong>This site is a work in progress!</strong> Please <%= link_to "contact me", root_path %> with any feedback or suggestions.</p>

	<h3><%= link_to "Math Quiz", "http://www.mathquiz.co", :target => "_blank" %></h3>
		<p>Math Quiz was the first Rails App I created.</p>
		<p>When I was in college interviewing for finance and consulting jobs, I wanted a quiz that I could set up to drill mental multiplication problems, where I could choose the factors and the length of the quiz, and it would give me a score.</p>
		<p>When I started learning Ruby, it was the first program I wrote after finishing <%= link_to "Chris Pine's tutorial", 'https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/', :target => "_blank" %>.</p>
		<p>When I started learning Rails, I wanted to try to convert <%= link_to 'that program', 'https://github.com/alexanderhughes/Mental-Math-Quiz', :target => "_blank" %> into a Rails app. <%= link_to "Math Quiz", "http://www.mathquiz.co", :target => "_blank" %> is the result!</p>

	<h4>Education</h4>
	<p>I received my B.A. <em>magne cum laude</em> in <%= link_to "History", "http://www.brown.edu/academics/history/", :target => "_blank" %> and <%= link_to "Economics", "http://www.brown.edu/academics/economics/", :target => "_blank" %> from <%= link_to "Brown University", "http://brown.edu", :target => "_blank"  %> in 2010.</p>
	<p>I focused on Early American and European Intellectual history, and still have an intense interest in art, philosophy, and political thought, especially as it relates to cultural, political, and social structures.</p>
	<p>In Economics, my coursework was significantly less abstract, and focused mostly on macroeconomics, economic growth, and some corporate finance.</p>
	<p>While at Brown, I was a General Manager of <%= link_to "The Brown Daily Herald", "http://browndailyherald.com", :target => "_blank" %>.</p>
	<p>My coding knowledge is self-taught, with lots of help from <%= link_to "piinecone", "http://www.piinecone.com", :target => "_blank" %>.</p>

	<div id="right">
	<h4>Professional Experience</h4>
	<p>In 2010, I joined the Japanese investment bank <%= link_to "Nomura Securities", "http://www.nomura.com", :target => "_blank" %> in its first formal analyst class following its <%= link_to "acquisition of Lehman Brother's international group assets", "http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/23/lehmanbrothers.banking1", :target => "_blank" %>.</p>
	<p>After training in capital markets and fixed income in London, I joined the Fixed Income Syndicate desk in New York, helping clients raise capital in the USD debt market. I was promoted to Associate in April, 2012. I left Nomura in June, 2014.</p>
	<p>I also spent a year and a half working on creating a premium Ready-To-Drink alcoholic beverage brand with bourbon, rum, gin, and vodka bases.</p>
