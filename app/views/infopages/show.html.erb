	<h4>Education</h4>
	<p>I received my B.A. <em>magna cum laude</em> in <%= link_to "History", "http://www.brown.edu/academics/history/", :target => "_blank" %> and <%= link_to "Economics", "http://www.brown.edu/academics/economics/", :target => "_blank" %> from <%= link_to "Brown University", "http://brown.edu", :target => "_blank"  %> in 2010.</p>
	<p>I focused on Early American and European Intellectual history, and still have an intense interest in art, philosophy, and political thought, especially as it relates to cultural, political, and social structures.</p>
	<p>In Economics, my coursework was significantly less abstract, and focused mostly on macroeconomics, economic growth, and some corporate finance.</p>
	<p>While at Brown, I was a General Manager of <%= link_to "The Brown Daily Herald", "http://browndailyherald.com", :target => "_blank" %>, the largest student-run organization serving the Brown community.</p>
	<p>My coding knowledge is self-taught, with lots of help from <%= link_to "piinecone", "http://www.piinecone.com", :target => "_blank" %>.</p>

	<h4>Professional Experience</h4>
	<p>In 2010, I joined the Japanese investment bank <%= link_to "Nomura Securities", "http://www.nomura.com", :target => "_blank" %> in its first formal analyst class following its <%= link_to "acquisition of Lehman Brother's international group assets", "http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/23/lehmanbrothers.banking1", :target => "_blank" %>.</p>
	<p>After training in capital markets and fixed income in London, I joined the Fixed Income Syndicate desk in New York, helping clients raise capital in the USD debt market. I was promoted to Associate in April, 2012. I left Nomura in June, 2014.</p>
	<p>I also spent a year and a half working on creating a premium Ready-To-Drink alcoholic beverage brand with bourbon, rum, gin, and vodka bases.</p>
